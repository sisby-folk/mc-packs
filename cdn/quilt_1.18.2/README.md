**Tinkerer's Quilt** is a minecraft modpack by Kapesi, Clawby, Herrah and Le'mer.     
It runs on minecraft version 1.18.2 and the **Quilt** mod loader


The design of the pack is focused around **three pillars**:

------

**Vanilla Compatibility**
 - **No new items, no new blocks, and no changes to worldgen.** Bring in old saves and possibly even keep Tinkerer's Quilt saves for vanilla use! (no guarantees)

**Usability, Accessibility, Discoverability**
  - More of the game accessible to more players in more pleasant ways.
    - **QoL changes** to reduce minor annoyances, **balance changes** to avoid pain points and flatten power creep through buffs, and **minor mechanic changes** to bring more depth and draw to easily-ignored systems.
      - Changes to avoid in-game pain points for certain players - Including changes for playing with "Vegetarianism" (no harming passive mobs), and buffs and improvements to pets and mounts.
    - **In-game sources of direction and information**, with quests covering both vanilla progression and features, along with what's changed in the pack. And of course, the latest and greatest incarnation of the in-game crafting and acquisition wiki - EMI by Emi.

      - Provide returning players information on new features and content the game has included since they might last have played.
  
      - Provide shortcuts to players to help them progress and to get into "Special Interest" systems they might otherwise avoid, and reward them for investing their time into each.

**Individual Expression**
 - Easily swappable character appearances that go further in-depth than the vanilla game - all explained in the quest book. Show your colours with **nonhuman skin features, varied heights, and new flavours of gameplay**.

   - Designed with systems in mind, reworking where possible to make these "expressives" swappable on the fly.

The name is based around the creators, not the content - sorry!

---

The **plus** and **modded** variants of this pack deviate from the first design point.
 - **Plus** offers a similar experience to the base pack, while including mods that still fit the pack design while adding items - such as **Waystones** for a full waypoint teleportation system.
 - **Modded** is similar to plus but includes my personal favourite major techlike mods - **Botania** and **Create**.

These changes can "overload" the pack in some ways. If you experience this, you might want to try choosing the default origins to simplify things.

# Installation

**Players**
 - Install [PolyMC](https://polymc.org/) and [Java 17](https://adoptium.net/temurin/releases/) (most windows users will want `Windows-x64-JRE-17-.msi`)

   - `winget install polymc` and `winget install --id EclipseAdoptium.TemurinJRE.17` works too.
   - [MultiMC](https://multimc.org/) is also supported (over polyMC) on its _development_ branch. Swap to this in `settings-> launcher` and restart.

 - Download [Tinkerer's Quilt.zip](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/raw/website/Installs/Tinkerer's%20Quilt%201.18.2.zip)

 - Drag and drop onto an open PolyMC/MultiMC window!

 - When prompted to select optional mods, press "OK" if you're unsure - A recommended set is already set by default.


**Hosting your own server** ([Download](https://github.com/sisby-folk/mc-packs/raw/website/Installs/Tinkerer's%20Quilt%201.18.2%20Server.zip)):
 - Run Quilt Installer and select `1.18.2` and the latest non-beta loader version. Then click "install"
 - Run Update.Bat to install the modpack, then Start.Bat to run the server       
[they're both just `java` - feel free to send me `.sh` equivalents]

**Extra Shaders**     
Along with those included in the packwiz version, tinkerer's quilt also includes "I hate blurring, AA, and lens effects!" configurations for:

 - [SEUS Renewed](https://www.sonicether.com/seus/#downloads)
 - [Triltons V8](https://johanfossum.wixsite.com/trilitons-shaders)

# Pack Features

## Questing System
***"It's like FTB Academy for Vanilla!"*** - Us, just now

### The Basics
Tinkerer's Quilt comes packed with a quest system that helps guide old and new players through the core progression of minecraft.      
<img width="425" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174097642-a5949541-b8e6-419b-bbfe-b3e4ecf90be8.png"><img width="325" height="260" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174098114-c5630f29-efaa-4473-9eb4-e53c4325f002.png">

The quests are designed to help get unfamiliar players on track, keep goals visible, and provide tactile engagement with the information provided.

### Godseeking
Looking to stray from the "adventure"? - we've got you covered!   
The quest system also includes quest trees that explore the various interests of the game.     
Do you want to...
 - ‚öîÔ∏è Know every weapon and kill every enemy? 
 - üè† Make bases in many environments? 
 - üåæ farm anything and everything, including crops? 
 - üó∫Ô∏è Explore the world and what's found there? 
 - üõ†Ô∏è Craft the best gear in your own workshop? 
 - üõ£Ô∏è Build transit infrastructure and achieve ludicrous speed? 
 - ‚öôÔ∏è Make terrifyingly complex machines and mechanisms? 

It's all there to pursue! Learn things even we didn't about before making this pack!     
Chase these interests to their full extent and you may just be noticed by the patrons of the pack's world...     
And be awarded with proof of your accomplishments! [ and unobtainable items ;) ]

Acquire power unheard of in vanilla! Get this banner in particular!   
<img width="100" height="200" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174106133-c4250e0d-6c95-403d-a72d-8914826febd1.png">


Don't get cocky though, some of those quests are absolutely devilish!

### Information
Critical information about the pack itself, right at your fingertips in the *Introduction* tab!     
<img width="380" height="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174103926-52a741ac-6d36-44e4-8153-be5fb7aff6c1.png"><img width="380" height="400" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174105386-7985c35c-fc25-4d8b-bb5a-724d55a7ebf7.png">     
Can't remember what's from the pack and from vanilla? the *Discrepancies* tab has you!


## Player Customization

Get customized down to the letter! We've got:      
 - Improved nonhuman skins with _Ears_ - add tails, horns, ears, claws, wings and more to your skin!
 - Swap skins on the fly with Fabric Tailor, and information on how to do so!
 - Mix up your playstyle (and acquire free species) with _Origins_ and _Origins: Classes_ - along with base origin rebalances by _OriginsPlus_!
 - Make adjustments to player height with our very own _Origins: Statures!_      
  <img width="760" height="262" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174215100-2b630688-8ef5-4429-b82e-9516c132915a.png">     
  
 - Swap origins on the fly with- ...Actually there's no fancy mod here, just a box stuffed with Origin-altering Orbs. Switch responsibly!
 - Playing multiplayer? No problem! swap your nickname any time with _Drogtor_ and swap your pronouns with _Player Pronouns!_
    - Oh, and they'll show on your in-game nameplate too, thanks _Fabrication_!

## QOL Improvements and Minor Additions

Too many to list! But they're all documented in game and in EMI, speaking of which - 

 - EMI! An advanced recipe book where you can search for any item in the game!    
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174112200-1cafe8ea-6fe3-48d6-b404-4baaff117840.png)
 - Craft swiftly using what you have, learn about items you're unfamiliar with, and more!
 - Not sure what you're looking at? that's okay! Hold a key and you'll find out _What The Hell Is That?_
![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/55819817/174112665-b8b534e2-5b8d-450e-91dd-260869086719.png)
 - Take _Notes_! write anything down you need! and copy the coordinates at your feet with ease.

And for our homebrew additions:
 - Obtain Leather, Water Breathing / Jump Boost Potions, Slime Balls, Glow Ink Sac, and Book and Quill - Without harming passive (or cute slimy) mobs!
 - Make Beacon pyramids out of Copper! just make sure you don't let it weather too much!
 - Repair enchanted tools without an XP cost, and reverse the work cost of anvil use using netherite scraps! - mending is an option, not a necessity!
